Description: For several possible existing fidelity patterns the values of 
  fidelity over time is calculated. These fidelity patterns can be used to 
  simulate data witin different hypothetical cluster randomized trials. 
  The package provides a function to coduct a whole simulation experiment to 
  investigate the performance of effect estimation within cluster randomized 
  trials with existing implementation error (measured by fidelity).
