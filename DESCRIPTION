Description: Calculate values of fidelity for different fidelity patterns with 
  simulated data witin different hypothetical cluster randomized trials. 
  The package provides a function to coduct a whole simulation experiment to 
  investigate the performance of effect estimation within cluster randomized 
  trials with existing implementation error (measured by fidelity).
